\section{Vision}

With the implementation of this system, the client is trying to create a central piece of software that can be used by all staff members of the Computer Science department of the University of Pretoria to maintain their academic publications.

However, the software will provide much greater functionality than merely listing all publications. One of the main features of the system will be the ability to add and edit publications, as well as specify a multitude of metadata items such as the title, (co)-authors, deadlines, progress towards completion, status (published, accepted, submitted etc.) and intended venue (conference, journal).

Additionally, the system will be used to provide users (who are authors of publications) with all manner of information regarding their Research Output Units and funding. This includes information such as expected units and funding, obtained units and funding, and shortfall of units.

The system will provide outputs in the form of an Excel spreadsheet which will illustrate the aforementioned author details both in a tabular fashion and graphically, most likely in the form of bar and/or line graphs. A sheet will be generated for each individual author, and a master sheet will be generated for the Research Leaders and Head of Department respectively.

A typical usage scenario of the system will be as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item A user, who in this case is an author as well as the Head of Department (giving him/her administrator rights), logs in to the system.
\item The user then adds a new publication on his/her profile page, filling in the relevant metadata items. The user will by default be added as an author.
\item The user realises that he/she made an error while filling in the title, and edits the title appropriately.
\item The units corresponding to the publication's venue (which have been assigned by the system) are automatically added to the user, and all unit-related calculations are made
\item The user's profile page is updated with the new publication and all related information.
\item The user then chooses to generate the Excel document which contains not only information about his/her Research Output Units and funding in a tabular and graphical fashion, but also similar information for all other members of the department, who are users. This is because the user has Head of Department rights. 

\end{itemize}

\section{Background}

Our group, Team Fox, had a meeting with the client, Ms Vreda Pieterse, on Wednesday, 17 February 2016. The client discussed that she requires the implementation of a system which will allow researchers to keep track of their publications, as well as view statistical information regarding their Research Output Units.

We have been given this topic for our mini project for the module COS 301. Furthermore, the mini project is to train us and help assist us in readying ourselves for the main project of this module.

This will give our group, Team Fox, the opportunity to gain experience on how to put together an SRS (Software Requirements Specification) that will help us and the client to better understand what is needed from the system and its functionality and how they would like to interact with the system. Consequently, if we better understand what our client wants the system to be, it will give us a better opportunity to implement a system that the client will be pleased with and which the client will want to use.
 	
In addition, the system will be used by the Computer Science department at the University of Pretoria. Hopefully the system will improve on the system(s) currently in use and will provide a basic structure of good quality which will enable it to be updated and improved in the future of its software development life cycle.
 	
Furthermore, the project might serve as an example to other students on how to implement such a system or it can be used as a basic structure and starting point for other institutes.

\subsection{Access Channel Requirements}

When considering the access channels of a target system, there are two main possibilities to consider: the human users of the system and whether any other systems need to be able to access the system. For both of these possibilities one then needs to consider through which ways they will access the system, what functionality the system requires these access channels to have and how these access channels will provide said functionality. 

The system required by our client (which will from herewith be referred to as the system or the target system) is a system through which researchers can keep track of their publications. The users of the system, the researchers, need a channel through which they can use the system. The client does not require any other systems to be able to access our system or use the functionality of our system for a higher processing scheme, at this stage.

The client would like the creation of two platforms through which the users of the system can access the system, namely:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Web Interface
	\item A Mobile Application (On the Android platform)
\end{itemize}

Both of these will have to access our system through the Internet - for the Android Application, this will require requesting permissions. The aforementioned platforms will need an interface through which to access our system, known as an Application Programming Interface (API). This interface will have to enable the passing of data from the system to the channel through which the user accesses the system. Considering the general functionality our system provides, and that communication would take place through the Internet, this API would have to be RESTful.

REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it is a software architectural style that deals with resources and what resources are accessed through using the HTTP user-oriented network protocol. This RESTful API would enable the transfer of data between our system and the platforms our client has chosen for users to access the system through - in our case over a network, namely the Internet.

Before we consider this API further and what data it shall pass and how our access channels will use the API, let us revisit the functionality the access platforms will need to have to provide the users with the target system's maximum functionality.
\begin{itemize}
	\item User log in
	\item Search functionality
	\item Ability to open excel spreadsheets
	\item Viewing of plain text
	\item Viewing of lists, tables etc.
	\item Viewing of links
	\item Ability to view information
	\item Ability to add information
	\item Ability to change information
	\item Ability to remove information
\end{itemize}

For the viewing of text, lists, links and the like, this will have to do with the Graphical User Interface (GUI) that the access channel provides. In the case of the Web Interface this can be designed using HTML and its associated counterparts such as CSS, Bootstrap and more. In the case of the Android Application, a number of classes and functions will be used. For example in the case of a list, one would use a ListView item on their user interface and this can be created using the android.widget.ListView class, and operations on said list will be done using the classes' associated functions.

The Search functionality would also need to be provided by the Graphical User Interface, but actual searching of the database used in our system will be done by the system itself, so our API would need to be able to request the system to do the search, when a user provides the required information for the search by interacting with the GUI.

For the ability to open Excel spreadsheets, in the Web Interface, this would imply the ability to download a file; while on an Android Application, this would imply the same thing as well as the improved ability to open the user devices' spreadsheet viewer.

As for the user log in functionality, users would provide user details through the GUI and the API would then need to pass user details for verification to the system and be able to receive a response about whether or not log in was successful or not. Another option that would be safer is the use of API authentication, this is a token based authentication in which the user would log in and if successful the system will respond with a unique token that can be used in future requests.

As we already know the information that will be displayed on these platforms GUIs will be provided through the RESTful API from our system. For this information, the API would need to get information from the system and be able to send changes including the addition and removal of information back to the system. Basically all the interaction between the system and these platforms will be done by the API with the following HTTP methods:
\begin{itemize}
	\item GET – For reading information from the system
	\item PUT – For adding information to the system
	\item DELETE – For removing information from the system
	\item POST – For making changes/edits to information on the system
	\item OPTIONS – For getting operations that can be performed by the system
\end{itemize}

While these platforms vary, they will both access the system through this API and use the Internet to communicate with the system. However the ways they call the API, process and deal with the responses will vary slightly on the two platforms. The API would provide a standard way for accessing the system despite what channel may be in use. These access channels thus simply need to provide users with the functionality that the target system requires on a GUI and use the API for providing users with the results and information from the system.

\subsection{Quality Requirements}

\subsubsection{Performance}
The system must work as efficiently as possible and not lag in delivering information to the user. Since this system will not be sending large amounts of data, it should not be difficult for the system to transfer the data speedily. In this implementation, we expect the network speed to dictate performance – not the system itself. Regardless, the system must be able to handle the full amount of users (approx. 100) concurrently without experiencing significant delays or errors. The success of this requirement can be measured in the time taken for a task to be completed under normal, and heavy-load scenarios

\subsubsection{Reliability}
It is imperative that the system not experience unnecessary downtime (period of in-operation of the system), thus preventing users from checking on or altering information on the system. An optimal uptime (period of normal operation of the system) within a month would be 99\% and upwards. Additionally there should not be frequent errors within normal operating parameters of the system. This means that simple logins (sessions), alterations or additions to the database should not cause errors which affect the system as a whole. Additionally, minor human errors, such as omission of information, should not be allowed to propagate through the system. But the system should rather allow the user to fix the error immediately – which will also contribute towards the accuracy of information in the database.

\subsubsection{Scalability}
The system will initially be implemented to manage papers pertaining to one faculty, but it might be necessary in the future to expand it to manage more faculties. The maximum amount for one implementation to manage should not exceed 11, and as such it should be scalable to that amount of faculties and the users associated with them. We make the assumption that the total users per faculty does not exceed 100 and, thus, the total on the system will never exceed 1100.

\subsubsection{Usability} 
Users must be able to login, edit information and logout without hassle. The interface should not be cluttered and should not contain redundant information. As management of information on the system is critical, accessing said information should be as simple as possible.

\subsubsection{Auditability}
In order to track changes and/or errors on the system, all actions by users must be logged as they occur. This includes, but is not limited to, log-in attempts, editing of information (whether successful or not) and log-outs. All errors should also be logged in order to simplify error-tracking. The logging system must not interfere with the users' actions and must not significantly affect performance. Logs must be timestamped and must contain information on which user executed an action – or where an error occurred.

\subsubsection{Security}
The system will be protected by a login system which will require a user to enter an ID and a password. The ID and password will then be compared to users in the system's database and, if an appropriate user is found AND the passwords (entered and stored) match, may the user proceed to access the system. This system must not, under any circumstances, allow unauthorised users to enter the system. If a user enters incorrect information, the system must notify the user and request that they correct the input before allowing them to continue to the rest of the system.

\subsection{Integration Requirements}

As the system will be accessed remotely through the Internet, it needs to integrate with web services. The GUI will be integrated online with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and any frameworks or libraries the developer decides to use as long as the system itself remains compatible on all browsers and does not use browser-exclusive functionality. The system must be integrated with the server, and thus make use of appropriate server-side technology such s AJAX and PHP. In summary, the system needs to be accessed anywhere on any browser through any device regardless of screen resolution, computer Operating System or hardware specification. Additionally, the system must work with these technologies in a robust and consistent manner. 

For mobile development, the system is required to integrate with the Android mobile Operating System. It must work correctly on all previous versions, and thus have no dependency on current feature sets. It must also be scalable to future Android releases and switching from account access through Android to web access and vice versa must be seamless and secure. On that note, the system must integrate well with security measures.

Externally, the system must be integrated with a database system such as LDAP, mongoDB or an appropriate alternative the developer decides on, provided that the system integrates with the database securely and it remains scalable. The system is also required to send emails to users, and thus it must have email integration either through external email servers or technologies, or an internally created one. Any libraries or packages needed to realise the functional requirements must be integrated with the other technologies being used. It was decided that the system does not need to integrate with Google Calender and thus it will not be using the Google API.

The system will generate reports in the form of spreadsheets and this must be integrated with the appropriate technology such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. The system will also regularly generate statistics and graphs so it is imperative the system integrates with statistical modelling technologies. As the system will be primarily an Internet-based application, the HTTP protocol suite will be primarily used for website data passing from client to server. The sending of emails should adhere to the SMTP suite and message passing through the system can be achieved through TCP. 

All integration needs to be seamless and not interfere with system performance. Security is also a major concern, and thus technologies integrated must not threaten the system's security as a whole or other technologies. The system must remain portable to any Android device and to any browser. As the system may grow and shrink as users are added and deleted, the system must be scalable. The data stored in the system will also increase and thus storage integration must be scalable as well. The system must remain reliable with each integrated technology added, and any errors must be able to be traced to the technology causing it.

\subsection{Architecture Constraints}

There are not too many architectural constraints to this system. However some constraints do exist, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item The only technological constraint we have been given is the fact that we cannot link the system to any external resources besides for sending an email reminder, to the user, about the due date for their paper.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The only constraint with regard to this would be that we would not be able to ease the way in which the user could keep track of their due dates by \textit{e.g. Adding the date directly to their google calendar}. Thus the user would manually need to add the date to their calendar or create a reminder for themselves (if they want to). Another problem could be that the email reminder that is sent by the system could be cluttered between all the other emails that have been received, by the user, and thus the user may forget about the reminder that was sent by the system. 
	\end{itemize}
\item The role of the user in the system \textit{(i.e. Author, Research Leader, Administrator, Head of Department)} determines their permissions on the system.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Author - May only edit metadata about a paper they are working on or have already published.
	\item Research Leader - May see all papers in his or her research group.
	\item Administrator/Head of Department - Should be able to view everything in the system (including all papers published, in progress or discontinued) as well as the number of units each user has earned. They may also add or remove users.
	\end{itemize}
\item The system must only cater for the Computer Science Department of the University of Pretoria. Users may not be anyone else outside the department. 
\item When viewing profiles of other users, one may not see the papers of the other users - despite the progress of these papers - or the number of units they have earned in total. 
\item However when viewing ones own profile, one may view their papers - regardless of progress - and also may view the number of units they have earned in total. 
\item Developing the system for the web can be very different from developing it for Android. This does, however, depend on the language(s) used to develop the Android application. If it is coded using web based languages it would be easier to port it to android. However if it is developed using Java the web-based system would not be very portable to Android. 
\item Additionally if this system ever needed to be ported to other mobile OS's such as iOS or Windows Mobile it would be difficult due to the difference in development language for each OS.
\item Lastly no papers, once added, may be deleted. Thus the database could become very large and make system backup and restore more difficult. Also there is no automatic backup of the data in the system, thus it would need to be done manually. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Architectural Patterns or Styles}
	Our research team have decided to use the MVC(Model-View-Controller)- and
	Layering architectural patterns for the research publication system for the mini
	project. Since the system should have a web-interface and a mobile Android interface
	it is necessary to divide the system into parts where the two interfaces are independent
	of each other, but both can have concurrent access to a central database. In addition,
	this is necessary, because the interfaces will likely use different client-side
	technologies for the graphical user interface and client logic.
	\newline
	\newline
	The structure of MVC in the system:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Model
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] The Model represents the database and how the user- and research
			data is structured, organized and stored in the database on the server-
			side. Furthermore, it provides an interface through the written server
			software by which the model can be manipulated from user interaction
			through the controller.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Controller
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] The controller partly represents the logic and the user-functionality
			of the system and is downloaded or exists on the client's side of the
			system. The controller interfaces with the model and the view
			where the controller;for example, verifies user-input and determines the validity
			of it; consequently, the controller manipulates the model through
			the server-side software interface and the user's view is updated
			with the updated data stored in the model.
		\end{itemize}
		\item View
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] The view represents the GUI(Graphical User Interface) that is displayed
			to the user and how it looks to the user when he/she interacts with it.
			The view gets updated when the model has been manipulated by some user's
			interaction with the controller.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	The MVC architectural pattern simplifies and modularizes the design of the research
	publication system in the following way:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] The GUI's of the website- and Android applications can be developed
	  	independent from each other.
	  	\item[-] The client-side software and functionality of the website- and Android
	  	applications can be developed independent from each other.
	  	\item[-] The database and server software can be developed independent from which
	  	client-side programming languages will be used and can be redistributed
	  	to work with other controllers and views.
	\end{itemize}
	The Layering architectural pattern makes use of a set of programmed layers. Each
	layer has been implemented to provide a certain unique functionality and can be used or
	reused by certain other layers.
	By making use of the Layering architectural pattern it can make the development
	life cycle of the research publication system more efficient in the following ways:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Layers can be tested and debugged individually.
	  	\item[-] Layers can be reused in other layered systems.
	  	\item[-] Layers can be updated and improved to replace the older ones.
	  	\item[-] Layers can be used to improve the security of the system; for example,
	  	all user-input must go through a security layer before it can be transmitted
	  	to other layers.
	  	\item[-] Layers can help the system to be formed as a united whole.
	  	\item[-] Layers helps the development of the system to be less complex, because
	  	the functionality is integrated into their separate layers to be worked on separately.
	\end{itemize}
	Examples of layers that can be used in the research publication system:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] A client-handler layer to handle what happens with user-input. Two different
	  	client-handlers might be implemented for web- and Android applications.
		\item[-] A display-handler layer to receive data from a data source and view it to the 	        user in an appealing manner. Two different display-handlers might be implemented for
	  	web- and Android applications.
		\item[-] A security-handler layer to verify user-input or file-uploads before it
	  	transfers it to the server.
		\item[-] A server-handler to modify the database or to retrieve data from the
	  	database.
		\item[-] etc.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Open Issues}

\begin{itemize}	
\item Should the admin be able to edit the meta-data of the papers or not?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Should the research leader be able to edit the meta-data of papers in their research group?
	\end{itemize}
\item What server will be used to host our site? 
\item Should we add any backup capabilities for the database?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item If so, will the admin be the only one able to backup the database?
	\end{itemize}
\item Is there a specific database that we need to use to store the information (i.e. MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4j etc.)?
\item Should the system be able to support more than 100 users if, for example, another employee was employed by the Computer Science Department? (i.e. should the addition of users past 100 be allowed?)
\item Should any user be able to add papers on behalf of other users? There may be risks involved when allowing this.
\item If a new user is added and they are already an author of a paper (when they were not a user of the system) should the papers, which the new user is part of, be displayed on their profile?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Will this new user receive units for the paper if it has already been published?
	\end{itemize}
\item If a paper has been "terminated" should the metadata still be editable while it is in a terminated state (besides for changing the state of the paper)?
\end{itemize}
